# Hand written digit recognition using Neural Networks

Implementation is done using regular Deep Neural Networks(DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). We observe how the program works better with CNN than regular DNN and understand the concepts.

### Remainder:
- All neural networks are referred as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN). The neural networks with more than one hidden layer are called Deep Neural Networks(DNN). Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are mainly used in image processing.
